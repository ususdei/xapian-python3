This repo allowes one to build xapian with python3 and lua bindings from git for arch linux in a standard environment.

`$ make`  will fire up a docker container running arch linux and build xapian from source.
The result will appear in the current directory.

Of course you can also just use the PKGBUILD alone.

I only tested it with xapian 1.3.3 and python 3.5 for now.
